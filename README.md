# Project PeaceMallet
This app was built to help track different stats during the course of a certain tabletop game. The idea of the app is to have it open on a laptop, ipad, tablet or even phone nearby so that both players can see all information that would be relevant at a quick glance.

## Future Plans
While the app currently tracks all basic information, I would like to add more detailed information down the road as I have time to develop it. Some of these things would be:
- A list of common stratagems that would be on buttons that when clicked, whoevers turn it is would have the corresponding amount of cp subtracted.
- Ability to keep track of what phase the player is currently in and then showing a list of stratagems based on that information.
- Ability for players to select their army faction at which point the app would suggest faction specific stratagems for each phase
- Ability to setup a tablet as a sort of scoreboard and then each player uses their phone to communicate with the tablet so not everyone is having to interact directly with the tablet.
- Ability to save game outcomes, who won, the final score, and then the ability to add notes describing what happened.
    - If I make this user account centric, a user could record their own notes for a game as to what they think they could have done better so they can use the app as a tool to get better at the game.
